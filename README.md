## Abstract 

> Herein, we propose a novel approach beyond supervised learning for effective pathological image analysis, addressing the challenge of limited robust labeled data. Pathological diagnosis of diseases like cancer has conventionally relied on the evaluation of morphological features by physicians and pathologists. However, recent advancements in compute-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems are gaining significant attention as diagnostic support tools. Although the advancement of deep learning has improved CAD significantly, segmentation models typically require large pixel-level annotated dataset, and such labeling is expensive. Existing studies not based on supervised approaches still struggle with limited generalization , and no practical approach has emerged yet.  To address this issue, we present a a weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) model by combining multiple instance learning and class activation map-based pseudo-labeling. For effective pretraining, we adopt the segment anything model (SAM)â€”a foundation model that is pretrained on large datasets and operates in zero-shot configurations using only coarse prompts. The proposed approach obtains enhanced knowledge of the attention dropout layer via the explicit visual prompting of SAM, which generates pseudo-labels.  To address the superiority of the proposed method, experimental studies are conducted on histopathological breast cancer datasets. The proposed method outperformed other WSSS methods across three open datasets, demonstrating its efficiency by achieving this with only 12GB of GPU memory during training.

## Overview
